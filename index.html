            <h2 class="featurette-heading">A LITTLE ABOUT ME.</h2>
            <p class="lead">Welcome to my page, I suppose should start with talking about my education and my academic
                and career dreams. I am a sophomore at California State University Long Beach studying computer science,
                but that is not what I want to necessarily do with my life I am passionate about cybersecurity and
                cyberwarfare and would one day like to work for a defense company or even create my own defense contractor.
                Computer science only plays a small part in my life at the moment, I love to travel and be active so I
                still want to see the world before I settle down somewhere. I am half Spanish and half mexican so I have
                been fortunate enough to travel between the two quite often and have learned that the world has so much
                to offer and there is so much to see. We often think that the world revolves around the US and that this
                is all there is, but that's false! Still have pleanty of adventures to go on and so do you!  </p>
